The cat sat on the mat.
I love to code.
Typing is fun.
She runs every morning.
Dogs bark at night.
The sun is bright.
I drink coffee every day.
We are learning Python.
Books are great friends.
Let's play a game.
Birds fly in the sky.
He likes to draw cars.
The baby is sleeping.
Do you like pizza?
Today is a good day.
We went to the park.
Apples are red and sweet.
She is my best friend.
They have a big dog.
I like sunny weather.
